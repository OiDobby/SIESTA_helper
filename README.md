# SIESTA_helper
This repository contains the post-scripting codes for handling [SIESTA](https://siesta-project.org/siesta/index.html) output files.  
One of the codes in this repository treats the bandstructure file for using the Gnuplot code, the other one is for the tranSIESTA, which is implemented in the SIESTA package to calculate the electronic transport.  
The second one provides conductance and I-V curve from calculated electronc transmission data, extracting in sub-directories.
